## Why Create A V3

freshenv2 was created using regular CSS styles. Not only did the front-end take me forever to complete, but it is embarassing to look at. For this reason, I decided that it would behoove me to learn a CSS framework. With many options to choose from, TailwindCSS stuck out to me.

freshenv2 was also an Express app that used Pug for html templating. In this project, I not only decided to use React for templating, but the NextJS framework for server-side rendering and routing.

This project differs from freshenv2 because it uses (1) TailwindCSS, (2) NextJS, (3) Prisma for DB management, (4) NextAuth for OAuth, and (5) Vercel for deployment.

## What I Learned

Among other things, I learned that when deploying an application, many problems can arise that were not present while locally hosting. One must be willing to waste time finding and solving the issue, or find a way to compromise.

As a self-taught developer, it is difficult to see a feature cause problems on deployment (in this case, the review section of individual salon pages). However, after wasting 5 hours attempting to solve the problem, I realized that these fixes would cost more than it would benefit my project. For that reason, salon pages on freshenv3 are without review sections.

P.S. I will try again soon!
